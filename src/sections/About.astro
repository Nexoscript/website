    Nexoscript is an open-source organization where we design, build, and
    experiment with modern software technologies across multiple platforms and
    programming languages. We use Nexoscript as a playground for innovation — a
    place where we prototype ideas, develop reusable libraries, and explore new
    approaches to networking, backend systems, and developer tooling. Our focus
    includes custom languages and tooling, modern packet-based networking in Go
    and Java, backend and authentication systems, web frameworks and UI
    libraries, as well as next-generation self-hosted platforms. We believe in
    clean code, performance, and continuous experimentation, and we openly share
    our work to learn, iterate, and collaborate with the community.
